# Movie Recommendation System

## Introduction
Welcome to our Movie Recommendation System! This system is designed to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and viewing history. Whether you're a movie buff or just looking for something new to watch, our recommendation system has got you covered.

## Features

### 1. User Profile
We start by creating a user profile that captures your movie preferences. This includes genres you like, movies you've enjoyed in the past, and any specific criteria you have for your movie choices.

### 2. Collaborative Filtering
Our recommendation system utilizes collaborative filtering to analyze the preferences of similar users. By identifying patterns and similarities in movie choices, we can suggest films that align with your taste.

### 3. Content-Based Filtering
In addition to collaborative filtering, we incorporate content-based filtering. This method recommends movies based on their features, such as genre, director, or actors, ensuring a diverse and personalized selection.

### 4. Hybrid Approach
To enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of our recommendations, we employ a hybrid approach that combines both collaborative and content-based filtering. This comprehensive method ensures a well-rounded and tailored movie list for you.
